<h2>Using ncurses</h2>

This week we will primarily focus on getting a window up and running using
ncurses. Ncurses is the library we will use to create an interactive program
in the terminal. To use it, we will include <code>ncurses.h</code>. Refer to
the link in the Prerequisites section for documentation that will help you
correctly use functions presented in this assignment.

<h4>Screens</h4>
To use ncurses, you must first create a screen, and set its environment
appropriately for use. One must initialize a screen with a call to the
<code>initscr()</code> function. This is what sets up the screen. Then
the rest is up to the implementer. For now, we will want to make calls
to <code>cbreak()</code> and <code>noecho()</code>, which tell ncurses
to return character keystrokes as they are typed. Furthermore, because
we want to listen for keystrokes, we want to call <code>raw()</code> and
<code>keypad(stdscr, TRUE)</code>. To tell ncurses where to put a cursor
if you want one at all, make a call to <code>curs_set()</code>. When we
are done using ncurses, you should call <code>endwin()</code>.

<h4>Windows</h4>
We break the screen into <code>WINDOW</code> objects. To create one, we
make a call to <code>newwin()</code>, which takes the size and indicies of the
top left corner of the window and returns a <code>WINDOW</code> pointer.
For the windows to become active, we must <code>refresh()</code> ncurses. Note
that to avoid memory leaks, we must also call <code>delwin()</code> when we are
done using the window. When choosing indices for the corners of the windows,
it may be useful to use <code>LINES</code> and <code>COLS</code>, which
are ncurses values storing the number of rows and columns, respectively,
in the screen.

<h4>Editing Windows</h4>
Editing windows occurs by moving an imaginary cursor and then setting the
character at that location. To move a cursor to the location (x, y) in a
window, we must call <code>wmove()</code>. There are two things to note
here: (x, y) is a coordinate inside a window, not a screen, so (0, 0) is
not necessarily a corner of the screen; and the <code>wmove</code> function
takes indices in row, column order (i.e. y then x). After declaring the
location with <code>wmove</code>, we make a call to <code>waddch</code>,
which tells ncurses what character to put at said location. For changes to
appear, you must refresh the window with a call to <code>wrefresh()</code>.
To receive keyboard input, you should use <code>getch()</code>. Be careful
when using this as it blocks until a keystroke is detected.


<h2>Using Smart Pointers</h2>

We will also work with smart pointers, using them as we build onto the
ncurses assignment from above. The two main purposes of smart
pointers are to make heap memory management more intuitive by eliminating
the need to free pointers; and to establish ownership of pointers. There are
two types of smart pointers that we will work with in this assignment:
<code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> and
<code>std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>. To use these, you must
<code>#include &lt;memory&gt;</code>.

<h4><code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code></h4>
We use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> when there is exactly one owner of the
pointer, hence "unique". The compiler will prevent any transfer of ownership
or copying of any unique pointers. Thus, you cannot use pass
<code>std::unique_ptr</code>'s as arguments to functions. The way a
<code>std::unique_ptr</code> is implemented is with a simple constructor and
destructor such that when the program leaves the scope in which it is
declared, the memory will be freed.

<h4><code>std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code></h4>
When using a pointer that is used across multiple scopes, we will want to use
<code>std::shared_ptr</code>'s. Any situation in which more than one variable
points to the same object, we will want a <code>std::shared_ptr</code>. Of
the cases that require these are those in which pointers are passed to newer
scopes, such as function arguments which copy the pointer. The way these
are implemented is with a reference counter. Each time a pointer is copied,
the reference increments; when it is destroyed, the reference count
decrements. When the reference count reaches zero, the pointer is freed.


<h4>Creating Smart Pointer Classes</h4>

In this assignment, we will want to create our own smart pointer class at
least once (for <code>WINDOW*</code>). Because freeing a <code>WINDOW*</code>
requires a call to <code>ncurses</code>'s <code>delwin</code>, we will need
to create our own smart pointer for it. In the references section is a link
showing a primitive example implementing a smart pointer class. To do this,
however, we will want to emulate more of a shared pointer, which means that
we need to implement a reference counter. This is simple: keep a pointer to
an <code>int</code> that is our reference counter, in addition to a pointer
to the <code>WINDOW</code> pointer itself. Then, in copy constructors
and assignments, we increment that counter, and in the destructor, we
decrement it. Finally, if the decremented counter is zero, we delete the
counter and call <code>delwin()</code>. Keep in mind that this class must
support all pointer operationss so that the smart pointer can be interacted
with as any raw pointer would. One way this can be done is to implement
implicit typecasting to <code>WINDOW*</code>. This is also useful because
it will allow you to use it as an argument to ncurses functions that expect
a raw pointer.


<h2>File Structure</h2>

The supplied Makefile expects a particular file structure which is pretty
standard in object-oriented programming. For this, we will separate files
by their respective purpose. The four types of files you will use in this
assignment are source files, object files, binary files and data files.
Source files are any file that contains code used in your implementation,
and is typically contained in a folder called <code>src</code>. Object files
are intermediary files created during compilation. We put these in a
separate folder called <code>obj</code> so they don't clutter our directories.
Binary files are the final, compiled executable. Typically, there is only
one binary file in a project, and it is stored in the <code>bin</code>
directory. Finally, sometimes there are files that contain input data to your
program. It isn't uncommon that there are large numbers of data files, so
we store them in a directory called <code>data</code>. Sometimes also data
files individually are extremely large, which makes it undesirable to move
them more than necessary. Having them all in one directory makes it easy
to ignore them in various contexts (e.g. in .gitignore). You should follow
this structure, keeping the Makefile at the top directory, when doing your
project.


<h2>Assignment</h2>

For this lab, you will create a <code>Display</code> class using smart pointers
instead of raw pointers. Put the class in <code>display.hpp</code> and
<code>display.cpp</code>. You will also create a <code>main.cpp</code> whose
contents are explained below. For this assignment, use unique smart pointers
where possible and shared smart pointers otherwise. Avoid raw pointers unless
you have a good reason not to. Edit the Makefile accordingly.

<h4>Display Class</h4>
Your display object is responsible for ncurses. You will have two windows,
one on top of the other. We want the <code>Display</code> class to be portable
while also being the only place we have to <code>#include &lt;ncurses&gt;</code>,
so you should keep a list of WINDOWs and expose a method to create and store
internally a WINDOW. Your create function should return a smart pointer to the
window for ease. This way, we don't need to change <code>Display</code> much
in the future regardless of application. While the design is entirely up to you,
you might also consider a <code>putChar(WINDOW*, x, y, char)</code> method that
draws a character at specified indices in the specified window and an
analogous <code>putLine</code> that truncates lines longer than the width
of the window. To use smart pointers here, you will also need to write a
<code>WindowSPtr</code>, class which is a shared pointer implementation for
<code>WINDOW</code>. If you feel that you will also require a unique pointer
implementation, you should also write a <code>WindowUPtr</code>, whose code
will essentially be a strict subset of that of the shared pointer's.

<h4>main.cpp</h4>
Your main loop will check that the function was invoked with exactly one
argument (which should be a valid filename). In this, create a Display
object with two windows, one on top of the other. The top will print the
filename from the command line and the bottom will respond to the user's
bottom keypresses. Showing keys pressed doesn't need to be fancy by
any means. This part is purely to acclimate yourself with
<code>getch()</code> and ncurses. TThe &lt;ESCAPE&gt;, key should stop ncurses
(<code>getch()</code> returns 27 when &lt;ESCAPE&gt; is pressed). It would
be best to store the return value into anything larger than a char (int will
suffice) so we can detect special characters such as the arrows.


<h2>Submission</h2>
Email me (Tim) a tarball of your entire directory, and on csman, submit with
no files so I can still give a grade back. I will email back a tarball with
your graded submission.
