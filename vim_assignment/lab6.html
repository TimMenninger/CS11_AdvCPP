<h2>Background</h2>
This will focus primarily on file I/O.  This is relatively straightforward,
and if you need help, you should look at the references or use Google.  File
I/O will mainly be done with the <code>stream</code> libraries, which allow
us to easily <code>open</code> files, read lines with <code>getline()</code>
and <code>write</code> to files.


<h2>Assignment</h2>
You will use your <code>Display</code> class from last week to create two
windows: one will be essentially the entire screen except for the bottommost
line, which will be a window on its own. You are to then create a
<code>Document</code> class that will be the object that handles our text
editing. The constructor should take a string that is the name of the file
being edited. If the file does not exist, you will create a new file. This
is an extremely elementary text editor. It will likely be slow. Next week
we will begin to optimize it.

<h4>Internal Storage</h4>
This class must support reading the file and saving it internally in a
<code>char[]</code> array. However, having one C string represent an entire
file will be extremely memory intensive, and we will work next week to make
some optimizations to this code. For now, keep to relatively small files. This
class at all times will display what is contained in this array, truncating
such that it no line exceeds the width of the screen and no more lines are
shown than can fit on the screen. Lines of files are delimited by '\n' or '\r'
characters. Continue using smart pointers throughout this assignment, and be
sure to use a <code>char</code> array and not a <code>std::string</code>.

<h4>Editing</h4>
On each keystroke, if a character was pressed, it should occupy the space
immediately to the left of the cursor. If it is in the middle of a line, it
should push the characters right. Be sure that hitting &lt;ENTER&gt; creates
a new line, pushing downward all of the lines below. Then write the string
to ncurses again so the updates appear both on the screen and the
<code>Document</code> member that contains the file contents. Continue to use
<code>getch()</code> to detect keystrokes. You should also give meaning to
a few keys. First, &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; is just a character. Make sure that
on backspace, the character immediately to the left of the cursor is deleted.
These functions use exclusively the cursor location to edit, so no functions
should take a location in the window. While you will not need it this week,
you may want to expose a function <code>setCursor(int, int)</code> that takes
a line number and character number in that line, and moves the cursor there.

<h4>Saving</h4>
There should be a means of saving the internal array to either an argued
filename or, if NULL, the same name of the file that was opened. For now,
we will save the entire file over, even if all new data was appended.
Depending on the size of the file, this may be slow.

<h4>Vim class</h4>
The goal of this is to emulate vim. While we may not recreate vim in the
fullest detail, we will start making vim-like keybindings. Listed here are
keybindings that are required to demonstrate functionality, and optional if
you are interested in familiarizing yourself with vim shortcuts. For now, we
will simply require enough to run INSERT mode. Create a <code>Vim</code>
class that has a reference to the <code>Document</code> it is editing. Add
to this class something that keeps track of the state. To do this, create an
<code>enum VimMode</code>, which will initially have only <code>DEFAULT</code>
and <code>INSERT</code>, but will eventually grow. Then, make the following
bindings:
<ul>Required:<ul>
    <li>i - enters INSERT mode when in DEFAULT mode. The first character
        typed should be immediately left of the highlighted character.</li>
    <li>a - enters INSERT mode when in DEFAULT mode. The first character
        typed should be immediately right of the highlighted character.</li>
    <li>W (upper case) - when in DEFAULT mode, saves the document.</li>
    <li>Q - when in DEFAULT mode, quits ncurses without saving.</li>
    <li>&lt;ESCAPE&gt; - enters DEFAULT mode when in any other mode. Recall
        <code>getch()</code> returns 27 for &lt;ESCAPE&gt;</li>
    <li>arrows - move cursor one row/column in the direction that was
        hit. <code>getch()</code> returns <code>KEY_UP</code>,
        <code>KEY_DOWN</code>, <code>KEY_RIGHT</code> and <code>KEY_LEFT</code>
        for the four arrows keys. This should occur in INSERT and DEFAULT
        modes.</li>
    <li>characters - when in INSERT mode, all characters should work. Don't
        do this with a catch-all <code>else</code>. Look up ASCII codes for
        characters and ensure that it falls in valid ranges (a-z, A-Z, 0-9,
        special characters, etc.)</li>
</ul></ul><ul>Optional:<ul>
    <li>H - moves cursor to first character in file</li>
    <li>x - deletes the character highlighted by the cursor</li>
    <li>R - enters a REPLACE mode (which you will need to create), and allows
        user to write normally, but the characters overwrite the cursor
        location before the cursor moves once right. If the cursor is at the
        end of the line, it appends to the line.
    <li>h, j, k, l - when in DEFAULT mode, moves the cursor one row/column
        left, down, up or right, respectively.</li>
    <li>numbers - when in DEFAULT mode, pressing numbers before a command
        will perform the command that many times. To do this, you might
        have a counter whose value is normally 1 until numbers are pressed,
        at which point this is updated. Then commands always defer to that
        value (which will usually be 1).</li>
</ul></ul>

<h4>Window Organization</h4>
The file contents should be displayed in the larger, top window. The bottom
window, which contains just one line, should contain the filename surrounded
by quotes, the number of lines in the file and the number of characters
(including newlines and other invisible characters) in the file. A file
named test.txt that contains 150 characters in 12 lines should have the bottom
window display <code>"test.txt" 12L, 150C</code>. When in INSERT mode, it
should display <code>-- INSERT --</code>, and in REPLACE mode (if done), should
display <code>-- REPLACE --</code>.


<h2>Submission</h2>
Email me (Tim) a tarball of your entire directory, and on csman, submit with
no files so I can still give a grade back. I will email back a tarball with
your graded submission.
