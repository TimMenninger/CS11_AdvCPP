<h2>Polymorphism</h2>

When editing text, every change can fundamentally be categorized as either an
insertion or a deletion. To support tracking of changes (and subsequently
undoing and redoing), we will employ polymorphism. We want to ultimately
add every change to a list, then on undo or redo, call the appropriate
function without the need to consider whether it was a deletion or insertion.
This can be accomplished by creating a <code>Change</code> interface that
<code>Insertion</code> and <code>Deletion</code> classes will implement. When
we instantiate a <code>Change</code> object, we essentially decide at creation
how it should act whenever e.g. <code>undo()</code> is called on this
<code>Change</code>. To create an interface, start by creating the base
class, in this example, <code>Change</code>. Decide what components are
constant among all <code>Change</code>'s, for example the text that changed,
and implement that like you would any other class. Then for the parts that
depend on the implementation we will make <code>virtual</code>. This tells
the compiler to defer definition details to any child class. In the end,
it will look something like
<pre class="prettyprint code">
    /* Class provides interface for children */
    class MyInterface {
        int allObjectsHaveThis;             /* To be defined by MyInterface */
        virtual void functionToDo();        /* Children must implement this */
    };

    /* Must implement the interface left by parent class */
    class MyInterfaceChild : public MyInterface {
        void functionToDo() { /* Do something */ };
    };
</pre>
Note that there can be a function definition in the parent class that is the
"default" if the children don't implement it.


<h2>Assignment</h2>

<h4>Optimizing Current Code</h4>
<p>
Update so if the cursor moves out of the window, reprint everything to give
the appearance of scrolling. If your window is 20 lines, you originally show
lines 0-19 of the file. If your cursor is on the bottom line and it moves
down, you should then show lines 1-20, leaving the cursor on the bottom line.
Similarly for the characters in each line. A good way to implement this is to
store the line and column numbers that should be at the top left of the
display, then start your iteration there when you write to the display.
</p>
<p>
Using this, we can make the editing section faster by only reprinting
characters that change. If a character was inserted (other than a newline),
rewrite only characters in that line, shifting right those after the new
character. If a new line is present, only rewrite the contents below it,
pushing down everything below the newline. The new line should now contain
everything that was in the same line to the right of the new character.
In our case, the time to print to the display is negligible, so we will make
this part OPTIONAL.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we will slightly improve saving, but more to come next week. For now,
the best we can do is simply not save if we don't have to. Keep track of
whether the file has been edited since the last save, and on save, only
write to a file if it has been edited OR it is writing to a new file (not the
one that was originally opened).
</p>

<h4>Undo and Redo</h4>
We want to start tracking changes so we can undo and redo. The way we will
do this is with a doubly-linked list of changes. The reason we do this instead
of an array is because we will always have a pointer to the next change to
undo, which is chronologically one before the next change to redo. We will
only ever access one of those two changes, and so accessing this linked list
will always be O(1). We can then take advantage of the O(1) insertion and
deletion without worrying about the usual linked-list drawback that indexing
is O(n). Implement this functionality such that each edit gets a
<code>Change</code>. In actual vim, an entire insert session would constitute
one change, but that is extremely tricky to implement, so for this, we can
treat each character chagne as one change. This means that everything that
happens during one continuous INSERT mode goes into one <code>Change</code>,
as does each edit by shortcut that occurs during DEFAULT mode (e.g. 'x' to
delete a character). Every <code>Change</code> should know the line and column
number (both 0 indexed) of the first character that changed, as well as a
string that contains what changed (either inserted or deleted).  It might also
have a reference to the <code>Document</code> so it can change it. To make it a
doubly-linked list, put <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> fields that
point to other <code>Change</code>'s. Finally, every change needs some
notion of how to undo and redo, but this depends on the type of change,
so these will be <code>virtual void undo() = NULL</code> and <code>virutal void
redo() = NULL</code>. Create <code>Insertion</code> and <code>Deletion</code>
classes that inherit from <code>Change</code> and implement <code>undo()</code>
and <code>redo()</code>, where <code>Insertion::undo()</code> deletes the
inserted code (which is stored in <code>Change</code> along with its
location in the file). Update your <code>Vim</code> class to contain a (smart)
pointer to the <code>Change</code> corresponding to the next
<code>undo()</code> call. Every time there is a change to the document, a
new <code>Change</code> should be added to your linked list and your
<code>nextUndo</code> should point to that most recent change. In doing this,
you lose any <code>Change</code>'s that you could have redone because you have
to reset the next pointer. You may need a dummy <code>Change</code> when this
list is empty to avoid ambiguity when you've undone every <code>Change</code>,
knowing whether there is anything you can redo.

<h4>Searching</h4>
Vim also supports search using regular expressions.  In C++, we will
(<code>#include &lt;regex&gt;</code>).  Refer to the / keybinding below to
see the user interface.  The best way to implement it would be to on search,
create a list of all indices of matches.  Then each time we want the next
match, we can just refer to that list.  Of course, if we edit the file, these
indices become useless, so each edit should clear this list.  For this case,
we should also keep somewhere the most recent regex that was searched, so if
we search, edit, try to find next match with 'n' (refer below), we don't have
to ask what the search was for before populating a new index list. This part
is OPTIONAL.

<h4>New Keybindings</h4>
Again, we will have required keybindings to exhibit functionality and
optional ones for enrichment.
<ul>Required:<ul>
    <li>all required keybindings from last week should still work</li>
    <li>u - undo the last change if in DEFAULT mode. If no more changes, do
        nothing.</li>
    <li>. (period) - redo the next change if in DEFAULT mode. If no more
        changes to redo, do nothing.</li>
</ul></ul><ul>Optional:<ul>
    <li>w (lower case) - in DEFAULT mode, moves the cursor to the first
        character of the next word in the file.</li>
    <li>b - in DEFAULT mode, moves the cursor to the first character of the
        current word (previous word if already on the first character) in the
        file.</li>
    <li>e - in DEFAULT mode, moves the cursor to the last character of the
        current word (next word if already on the last character) in the
        file.</li>
    <li>/ (forward slash) - when in DEFAULT mode, enters forward search mode.
        Anything typed after the slash and before an &lt;ENTER&gt; will be
        searched (don't search until &lt;ENTER&gt; or it will slow you down
        a lot). On &lt;ENTER&gt;, the cursor moves to the next instance of
        that string in the file, wrapping if necessary. The cursor does not
        move if the string is not found. In this mode, the bottom ncurses line
        should display <code>/&lt;string_to_search&gt;</code>. The searched
        string should be stored somewhere for future reference, as should the
        search direction for when we leave this state.</li>
    <li>? (question mark) - when in DEFAULT mode, enters reverse search mode.
        This does the same thing as forward search except it moves the cursor
        to the beginning of the first instance BEFORE the current cursor
        location. In this mode, the bottom line should display
        <code>? &lt;string_to_search&gt;</code>.</li>
    <li>n - when in DEFAULT mode, recalls the most recently searched string
        and direction and finds the next instance of it in the appropriate
        direction.</li>
</ul></ul>
