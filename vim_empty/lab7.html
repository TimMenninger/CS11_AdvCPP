<h2>Polymorphism</h2>

When editing text, every change can fundamentally be categorized as either an
insertion or a deletion. To support tracking of changes (and subsequently
undoing and redoing), we will employ polymorphism. We want to ultimately
add every change to a list, then on undo or redo, call the appropriate
function without the need to consider whether it was a deletion or insertion.
This can be accomplished by creating a <code>Change</code> interface that
<code>Insertion</code> and <code>Deletion</code> classes will implement. When
we instantiate a <code>Change</code> object, we essentially decide at creation
how it should act whenever e.g. <code>undo()</code> is called on this
<code>Change</code>. To create an interface, start by creating the base
class, in this example, <code>Change</code>. Decide what components are
constant among all <code>Change</code>'s, for example the text that changed,
and implement that like you would any other class. Then for the parts that
depend on the implementation we will make <code>virtual</code>. This tells
the compiler to defer definition details to any child class. In the end,
it will look something like
<pre class="prettyprint code">
    /* Class provides interface for children */
    class MyInterface {
        int allObjectsHaveThis;             /* To be defined by MyInterface */
        virtual void functionToDo();        /* Children must implement this */
    };

    /* Must implement the interface left by parent class */
    class MyInterfaceChild : public MyInterface {
        void functionToDo() { /* Do something */ };
    };
</pre>
Note that there can be a function definition in the parent class that is the
"default" if the children don't implement it.

<h4>Optimizing Current Code</h4>
<p>
We are going to revisit the code from last week to make some optimizations.
The first is going to fix the egregious storage of a file in one C string.
It is extremely bulky, and at some point, there won't be one contiguous
block of memory large enough to hold the file. Fix your internal storage
to instead hold an array of C strings (<code>char**</code>), where each string
contained is a line of the file. How you decide to do this is up to you, but
a good strategy might be to originally <code>malloc</code> enough space for
the entire line, or half of it, and if you must <code>realloc</code>, double
the length. That said, you need to keep track of the length of lines. One
possible way of doing this is to encode it into the first four bytes of the
string (typecasting will be your friend), and when writing to ncurses, start
at the fourth byte. It may also be useful to keep a pointer in your
<code>Document</code> class to the place in your array that the ncurses cursor
is so you know where new characters go. Now that we have this better system
in place, if the cursor moves out of the window, reprint everything to give
the appearance of scrolling. If your window is 20 lines, you originally show
lines 0-19 of the file. If your cursor is on the bottom line and it moves
down, you should then show lines 1-20, leaving the cursor on the bottom line.
To help facilitate times when you must rewrite the entire display, you should
add to your <code>Document</code> class a <code>refresh(line, column)</code>
that will clear your display and then fill it with the top left character
being at the argued line and column in the file.
</p>
<p>
Using this, we can make the editing section faster by only reprinting
characters that change. If a character was inserted (other than a newline),
rewrite only characters in that line, shifting right those after the new
character. If a new line is present, only rewrite the contents below it,
pushing down everything below the newline. The new line should now contain
everything that was in the same line to the right of the new character.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we will slightly improve saving, but more to come next week. For now,
the best we can do is simply not save if we don't have to. Keep track of
whether the file has been edited since the last save, and on save, only
write to a file if it has been edited OR it is writing to a new file (not the
one that was originally opened).
</p>

<h4>Undo and Redo</h4>
We want to start tracking changes so we can undo and redo. The way we will
do this is with a doubly-linked list of changes. The reason we do this instead
of an array is because we will always have a pointer to the next change to
undo, which is chronologically one before the next change to redo. We will
only ever access one of those two changes, and so accessing this linked list
will always be O(1). We can then take advantage of the O(1) insertion and
deletion without worrying about the usual linked-list drawback that indexing
is O(n). Implement this functionality such that each vim-keybound edit gets
a <code>Change</code>. This means that everything that happens during one
continuous INSERT mode goes into one <code>Change</code>, as does each edit by
shortcut that occurs during DEFAULT mode (e.g. 'x' to delete a character).
Every <code>Change</code> should know the line and column number (both 0
indexed) of the first character that changed, as well as a string that
contains what changed (either inserted or deleted). To make it a doubly-linked
list, it will also need a <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> field that
points to other <code>Change</code>'s. Finally, every change needs some
notion of how to undo and redo, but this depends on the type of change,
so these will be <code>virtual void undo() = NULL</code> and <code>virutal void
redo() = NULL</code>. Create <code>Insertion</code> and <code>Deletion</code>
classes that inherit from <code>Change</code> and implement <code>undo()</code>
and <code>redo()</code>, where <code>Insertion::undo()</code> deletes the
inserted code (which is stored in <code>Change</code> along with its
location in the file). Update your <code>Vim</code> class to contain a (smart)
pointer to the <code>Change</code> corresponding to the next
<code>undo()</code> call. Every time there is a change to the document, a
new <code>Change</code> should be added to your linked list and your
<code>nextUndo</code> should point to that most recent change. In doing this,
you lose any <code>Change</code>'s that you could have redone because you have
to reset the next pointer. You may need a dummy <code>Change</code> when this
list is empty to avoid ambiguity when you've undone every <code>Change</code>,
knowing whether there is anything you can redo.

<h4>New Keybindings</h4>
Again, we will have required keybindings to exhibit functionality and
optional ones for enrichment.
<ul>Required:<ul>
    <li>all required keybindings from last week should still work</li>
    <li>u - undo the last change if in DEFAULT mode. If no more changes, do
        nothing.</li>
    <li>. (period) - redo the next change if in DEFAULT mode. If no more
        changes to redo, do nothing.</li>
    <li>$ - in DEFAULT mode, move cursor to the last character of the
        line.</li>
    <li>^ - in DEFAULT mode, move cursor to the first character of the
        line.</li>
</ul></ul><ul>Optional:<ul>
    <li>b - in DEFAULT mode, moves the cursor to the first character of the
        current word (previous word if already on the first character) in the
        file.</li>
    <li>e - in DEFAULT mode, moves the cursor to the last character of the
        current word (next word if already on the last character) in the
        file.</li>
    <li>w (lower case) - in DEFAULT mode, moves the cursor to the first
        character of the next word in the file.</li>
    <li>/ (forward slash) - when in DEFAULT mode, enters forward search mode.
        Anything typed after the slash and before an &lt;ENTER&gt; will be
        searched. On &lt;ENTER&gt;, the cursor moves to the next instance of
        that string in the file, wrapping if necessary. The cursor does not
        move if the string is not found. In this mode, the bottom ncurses line
        should display <code>/ &lt;string_to_search&gt;</code>. The searched
        string should be stored somewhere for future reference, as should the
        search direction.</li>
    <li>? (question mark) - when in DEFAULT mode, enters reverse search mode.
        This does the same thing as forward search except it moves the cursor
        to the beginning of the first instance BEFORE the current cursor
        location. In this mode, the bottom line should display
        <code>? &lt;string_to_search&gt;</code>.</li>
    <li>n - when in DEFAULT mode, recalls the most recently searched string
        and direction and finds the next instance of it in the appropriate
        direction.</li>
</ul></ul>
