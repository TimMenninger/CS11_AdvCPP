<h2>Threading</h2>
This week, we will take everything we have and make it all work together
using threads. Threading occurs in two steps: we <code>create</code> the
thread using a function pointer and arguments, and we <code>join</code>
the threads, which prevents the program from continuing until all threads
have terminated. This part is relatively straightforward. The tricky parts
are ensuring that none of the threads get in another's way (talked about in
the next section) and using threads in a way that actually speeds up the
program. Threads are really only useful in scenarios where the program sits
idly for an extended period. This could happen as a result of blocking
functions such as <code>getch()</code>, or I/O operations that are slow such
as reading/writing to files and writing to the display. Thus, in this
assignment, we will use threads to listen for keystrokes, write to the
file system (on saving) and write to the display. The spawning thread will be
the one that writes to the display (via ncurses). To use threads, we will use
<code>std::thread</code>, which will require that we
<code>#include &lt;thread&gt;</code>.


<h2>Shared Resources</h2>
When threading, you must be EXTREMELY conscientious of memory that is accessed
by more than one thread.  One way to do this is with locks (also known as
mutexes).  These work as a resource that a thread must "own" before reading
or writing.  Only one thread can "own" it at any one time.  Thus, if a thread
owns the lock and is writing to the shared resource, then no other thread
can be writing because it does own the lock.  The two main operations we
can do with a lock are acquire and release.  In our program, we will use
blocking locks, which means acquire will not return until it has the lock.
This is very susceptible to deadlocking, so we will have to be careful in our
implementation.  This same construct is also used before reading shared
resources because we don't want one thread to read a value, another to change
it, then the original to respond to the original, now wrong, value.  This
might seem inefficient because it allows only one thread to read a shared
resource at any one time.  The solution to this is a read-write lock.  The
difference here is when trying to acquire the lock, you declare whether it is
to read or write.  The way these work is the lock keeps track of how many
threads are reading at all times and uses this count to determine whether it
should provide access to the resource.  Each time a new thread wants to acquire
to read, the count increments.  When it releases from reading, the count
decrements.  When a thread wants to acqurie to write, it will block until no
other thread is accessing the resource, both readers and writers.  In any case,
acquire will always block until nobody is writing.  There is one particularly
interesting use case:
<pre class="prettyprint code">
    if (we want to write to shared resource) {
        acquire write lock
        do the write
        release write lock
    }
</pre>
This naive solution for such a case will not work.  The first issue is that
we must presumably read the shared resource to check the <code>if</code>
condition.  One possible solution is to move the write lock acquisition to
outside the <code>if</code>.  While this works, it's slow because it must
wait until nobody is reading before checking.  Furthermore, it forces any other
threads wanting to read to wait until it is done.  In the end, it may not even
do a write.  Therefore, we will want to acquire a read lock before the if
statement.  Now, the issue is when the condition evaluates to true.
We can't acquire the write lock before releasing the read lock, because
that will deadlock as the write acquire waits for the read release that doesn't
occur until after the if.  Likewise, it can't release the read lock, acquire
the write lock, then write because in between the release and acquire, the
resource may change such that we no longer want to write.  The fastest solution
to such a scenario, which seems inefficient, is to do the same check twice.
For example:
<pre class="prettyprint code">
    acquire read lock
    if (we want to write to shared resource) {
        release read lock
        acquire write lock
        if (we want to write to shared resource) {
            do the write
        }
        release write lock
    }
    release read lock
</pre>
To use read/write locks, we will use <code>std::shared_mutex</code>, which
will require that we <code>#include &lt;shared_mutex&gt;</code>.  This
particular object uses the nomenclature <code>lock()</code> to acquire the
lock to write, <code>lock_shared()</code> to acqurie the lock to read,
<code>unlock()</code> to release the lock after writing, and
<code>unlock_shared()</code> to release the lock after reading.  Note that
there also exist <code>try_lock()</code> and <code>try_lock_shared()</code>
which return <code>true</code> if and only if it acquires the lock, and do NOT
block if lock acquisition fails.


<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
Your assignment is essentially to finish Pacman, which will require threading.
To do this, <code>Game::run()</code> should spawn a thread for each of the
ghosts' <code>move()</code> function and a thread for <code>getch()</code>
before starting the loop where it updates the map continuously.  You will need
to identify places where more than one thread accesses the same shared
resource and make this thread-friendly.  In some places, it will be easiest
to read/write using an accessor function, then handle the locking in that
function.  Other places won't be as simple because you will need the lock
for longer than just the reading or writing part of the operation.  Because we
want <code>getch()</code> in a thread of its own, we should move that out of
<code>Game::run()</code> and into its own wrapper function within
<code>Game</code>.  This wrapper function will listen for keypresses and handle
any accordingly, which includes arrows triggering calls to
<code>Pacman::setDirection()</code> and &lt;ESCAPE&gt; exiting the game.
In total, there will be 6 threads running.  Make sure to introduce locks
wherever multiple threads need to access the same thing.  In the spirit of
drilling smart pointers into you, continue using exclusively smart pointers
where applicable.
</p>
<p>
Finally, update the <code>Game</code> class. In particular, you should
edit your <code>Game::run()</code> to loop and update the map based on the
characters' locations and the dots Pacman has eaten.  This will consist of
removing dots from the map/window, and moving characters around so the player
can follow Pacman and the ghosts.  Also update the <code>Ghost</code> class to
monitor all of their locations; if Pacman occupies the same cell as a ghost,
one of their <code>onDeath()</code> should be called depending on the ghost's
state at the time.  There should be a timer in this loop that is used to
determine the ghosts' state (unless they are in frightened mode).  It should
also keep track of the score.  Each little dot that Pacman eats is worth 10
points and each big dot is worth 50.  When Pacman eats a big dot and the ghosts
are frightened, Pacman also earns points for eating ghosts.  The first is worth
200 points, and each thereafter is double the previous.  This restarts each
time a new powerup is eaten.  Thus, you should also keep track of this.  You
will need a second timer and a counter for how many ghosts Pacman's eaten.
This can probably be a variable whose scope is inside the <code>run()</code>
function, along with the score variable and number of lives left.  The stopping
condition of this loop should be when the game is over, either from the user
pressing &lt;ESCAPE&gt; or Pacman losing all of his lives (add a lives counter
to your game class to be able to check this).  Make sure that when the game
is over, you notify the other threads (by updating your <code>isRunning</code>
flag if you followed that suggestion last week).  Continually print the score
and lives left to the text window in any way you like.  You should also have
a small <code>usleep</code>, maybe one millisecond, in your <code>run()</code>
loop to avoid it taking 100% cpu coverage.

Email me (Tim) a tarball of your entire directory, and on csman, submit with
