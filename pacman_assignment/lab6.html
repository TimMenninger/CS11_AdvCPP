<h1>Lab 6: File I/O</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

This will focus primarily on file I/O.  This is relatively straightforward,
and if you need help, you should look at the references or use Google.  File
I/O will mainly be done with the <code>stream</code> libraries, which allow
us to easily <code>open</code> files, read lines with <code>getline()</code>
and <code>write</code> to files.

<h2>Assignment</h2>

For this lab, you will first create two classes: <code>Map</code> and
<code>Game</code>, and a <code>Cell</code> struct.  Name your files as you wish,
but ensure that your Makefile is consistent with your nomenclature.  When
implementing your classes, make all members private, exposing public accessor
and mutator functions.  The <code>Cell</code> struct doesn't matter as much
because it is just a neat way of storing map data.

<h4>Cell Struct</h4>
Your <code>Cell</code> struct will contain metadata about the cells in the
array.  The provided pacman map gives 3 characters per cell.  <code>Cell</code>
should contain those three characters (which will be displayed in ncurses)
and some metadata, namely some sort of <code>enum CellType</code> (dot,
eaten dot, wall, powerup, etc.).

<h4>Map Class</h4>
Your map object must contain the map and metadata about the map (such as
height and width).  The map should be stored in an array of <code>Cell</code>
objects, which you are also to define.  The <code>Map</code> class is then
responsible for reading a datafile containing a map, storing it in cells and
displaying the map.  You can create <code>static const</code> values in your
map class to define the constant dimensions of your map, which should be large
enough to display the map.  You should also have a member function that
returns the type of <code>Cell</code> at a particular index, and it will be
helpful to add a <code>bool isWall()</code> function, which also takes an
index as argument.

<h4>Game Class</h4>
Your game class just needs the map object and display object the game is
using.  It should set up windows using your <code>Display</code> class so it
can begin writing to them.  It should expose a <code>void run()</code> function
that will run the game.  Have a call to <code>getch()</code> in
<code>Game::run()</code> to listen for the ESCAPE key as a signal to return
and end.  Note that <code>getch()</code> will return <code>27</code> when the
ESCAPE key is detected.  You will also want this class to have a flag that
is set when the game is running, and clears as soon as the game is over.
This will give a condition for loops later in the project.  The
<code>Game</code> class will also have metadata about the game, such as
the score.

<h4>main.cpp</h4>
Your main loop will check that the function was invoked with exactly one
argument (which should be a filename leading to the map to load), create a
game instance, then run the game.
