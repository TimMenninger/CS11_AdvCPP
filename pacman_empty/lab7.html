    Ghost Behavior
</a></ul>

<h2>Virtual Functions</h2>

We will begin to move toward our final product: a Pacman game.  Our final
game will have one base <code>Ghost</code> interface that all of the four
ghosts will implement.  We do it this way so we can keep an array of the
ghosts, and iterate over it to decide each next move based on different
heuristics, without having an entire object definition for each ghost.  This
is simple enough.  You should decide what information is consistent among
all ghosts and which isn't.  In this case, every ghost will have an (x, y)
location, a direction, a speed, a state and a target (more later0).  Thus,
these can all be defined in the <code>Ghost</code> class as normal.  However,
every ghost has a different heuristic to decide the next square it will move
to.  We must thus tell the <code>Ghost</code> class that the
<code>move()</code> function dictating the ghost movement must be there,
but is yet to be defined.  We do this using virtual functions, putting a
<code>virtual void move()</code> in <code>Ghost</code>, forcing every child
to implement <code>void move()</code>.  In the end, it will look something
like
<pre class="prettyprint code">
    /* Class provides interface for children */
    class MyInterface {
        int allObjectsHaveThis;             /* To be defined by MyInterface */
        virtual void functionToDo() {};     /* Children must implement this */
    };

    /* Must implement the interface left by parent class */
    class MyInterfaceChild : public MyInterface {
        void functionToDo() { /* Do something */ };
    };
</pre>
Note that there can be a function definition in the parent class that is the
"default" if the children don't implement it.


<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
You will create a <code>Ghost</code> class/interface that the four ghosts will
implement (which means you'll also need classes for the four ghosts).  Every
ghost will have a location, direction, speed (cells per second; Pacman moves
~3 cells per second), state and target.  However, there should be a
<code>virtual void move()</code> that the four child classes,
<code>Inky</code>, <code>Blinky</code>, <code>Pinky</code> and
<code>Clyde</code>, will implement independently (and inherit the rest from
the <code>Ghost</code> class).  This will be each ghost's heuristic deciding
how to move.  The <code>move()</code> will be a loop with a call to
<code>usleep(int microseconds)</code> to define a speed of the ghost (to use
this, <code>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</code>).
For how to implement each respective ghost heuristic, refer to the descriptions
below. Note that they rely on knowledge of all characters' locations, so
you Ghost class will also need access to that. A good way to do this is to
have a reference to the <code>Game</code> it is a part of. Additionally,
there should be a <code>virtual void onStart()</code> function, as each ghost
has a different starting condition and location.  This function will be called
at the top of <code>move()</code> and loop until the starting condition is met,
at which point it will move the location to just outside the ghost house and
set the target cell accordingly.  There could also be a <code>virtual void
onDeath()</code> function that sets exactly which cell the ghost goes to after
dying, or you can have one for all Ghosts and just set their target cell to
any open cell inside the ghost house. There should also be a method that allows
the <code>Game</code> class to change the state of any or all of the ghosts.
The state rules of the ghosts are explained below.  OPTIONAL: You can look
into more ghost behavior and implement that if you so wish.  For example,
the ghosts (and Pacman) change speed based on time and dots eaten.  This is
purely up to you and to what detail you want to make this game.
</p>
<p>
You will also create a <code>Pacman</code> object that controls Pacman.  This
should be less work than <code>Ghost</code> because there is no inheritance
and he is user-controlled.  All <code>Pacman</code> needs is a direction,
location speed, a reference to the <code>Game</code> it is playing,
a <code>void move()</code> function that just moves Pacman
forward in the direction he's facing at speed, or stops him if a wall
is obstructing his forward movement, a <code>void setDirection()</code>
function that sets Pacman's direction, because <code>getch()</code> will be
called in <code>Game</code>, and a <code>getLocation()</code> and
<code>getDirection()</code> so the ghosts can compute their next move based on
where Pacman is in the map.  Everything else should just be in the
constructor (initial position and direction).
</p>
<p>
Finally, update the <code>Game</code> class.  This should now have an array
of <code>Ghost</code>'s and a <code>Pacman</code>. The stopping
condition of this loop should be when the game is over, either from the user
pressing &lt;ESCAPE&gt; or Pacman losing all of his lives.  It will thus
help for <code>Game</code> to have some sort of <code>isRunning</code> flag
that is accessible by all <code>move()</code> functions.  This class also needs
some way for the ghosts to know how many dots have been eaten and how many
are left (one of the ghosts waits until 1/3 of the dots are eaten).  Ideally,
dots are counted from your map and not hard-coded.  Finally,
there should be a <code>score</code> field.  It may also help
with <code>move()</code> functions if you expose somewhere a
<code>bool isWall(int x, int y)</code> function.
</p>
<p>
In the end, you should have all of the ghosts and Pacman almost working.  The
last issue is that everything is blocking each other.  <code>getch()</code>
doesn't return, stopping all animation, and all four ghosts' and Pacman's
<code>move()</code> functions are an infinite loop.  The next assignment
explores using threads to allow these to run concurrently.  For now, nothing
will work together.  To see functionality, you should comment out the blocking
bits of code and run only one ghost at once.

<h4>Characters</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Pacman - Should respond to the arrow keys to change direction.  These
    are ncurses macros, <code>KEY_UP</code>, <code>KEY_DOWN</code>,
    <code>KEY_LEFT</code> and <code>KEY_RIGHT</code>.  Pacman should know his
    direction and continue moving in that direction until either he changes
    direction, or he hits a wall, in which case he stops, continuing to face
    the wall.  If Pacman occupies the same cell as a ghost, he dies and the
    player loses a life, unless the ghost is in frightened mode (after Pacman
    eats a powerup), in which case the ghost dies and goes back to the center
    to be re-released. Pacman starts between cells (13, 25) and (14, 25), using
    (0, 0) as the top left corner wall.  He originally faces left.</li>

    <li>Ghosts - When ghosts exit the ghost house, they start between cells
    (13, 12) and (14, 12).  The movement of ghosts is governed by the idea of a
    target cell on the map.  What exact cell is "targeted" depends on the
    state the ghost is in and which ghost it is (more later).  Ghosts can only
    look one cell ahead (so they don't perform any complex shortest-path
    algorithms to decide where to go).  Given the ghost's current position and
    keeping the state constant, it will move to the square whose LINEAR
    DISTANCE to its target cell is the shortest, without ever reversing
    direction.  If two cells are equidistant, the ghost chooses based on the
    hierarchy up > left > down (it can never choose right based on this
    order).  The only time a ghost can reverse direction is as a result of
    a state change.  There are three possible ghost states: chase, scatter and
    frightened.  In your code, you should use an <code>enum GhostState</code>
    for these.  In chase state, the ghosts choose their target cell based on
    Pacman's location; in scatter state, the ghosts choose their target cell
    to be one of the four corners; and in frightened state, the ghosts choose
    a new direction randomly at each intersection (without reversing).  When
    ghosts die, they go to any open spot in the ghost house then leave
    immediately no longer in frightened mode (they will be in scatter or
    chase based on the schedule below). The ghosts' state is chosen as follows,
    starting at the beginning of each life:
    <ul>
        <li>7 seconds scatter</li>
        <li>20 seconds chase</li>
        <li>7 seconds scatter</li>
        <li>20 seconds chase</li>
        <li>5 seconds scatter</li>
        <li>20 seconds chase</li>
        <li>5 seconds scatter</li>
        <li>chase permanently</li>
    </ul>
    You can set ghosts' speeds how you want. In chase and scatter modes,
    their speeds are about the same as Pacman. In frightened mode, their
    speeds are about 2/3 of Pacman's. When Pacman eats a powerup, ghosts enter
    frightened mode for 7 seconds (the ghosts turn blue for 5 seconds, then
    blink blue and white for 2). This does not stop the scatter/chase timer!
    When Pacman eats a ghost in frightened mode, it goes back to the center
    and on exit, resumes scatter or chase.  All timing for states will be
    done in the <code>Game</code> class (in next weeks assignment, but by
    all means you can do that now).
    <ul>
        <li>Blinky (Red) - The red ghost starts immediately outside the door
        of the ghost house.  In scatter mode, pursues the tile one above the
        top right corner wall (this is not reachable, so it will never
        reach its target).  In chase mode, pursues the tile Pacman occupies.
        Blinky's starting position is between (13, 12) and (14, 12), but for
        simplicity you can choose one or the other.</li>
        <li>Pinky (Pink) - The pink ghost starts inside the ghost house, but
        exits as soon as the red ghost vacates the spot outside the door.
        In scatter mode, pursues the tile one above the top left corner wall
        (this is not reachable, so it will never reach its target).  In chase
        mode, pursues four tiles ahead of the tile that Pacman occupies (ahead
        is defined by the direction Pacman is facing).  Pinky's starting
        position is between (13, 15) and (14, 15).</li>
        <li>Inky (Teal) - The teal ghost starts inside the ghost house and
        exits as soon as Pacman has eaten 30 dots.  In scatter mode, pursues
        the tile one below the bottom right corner wall (this is not reachable,
        so it will never reach its target).  In chase mode, the target cell
        is decided by choosing the cell two ahead of Pacman, drawing a vector
        from Blinky's position to that cell, doubling the length of that
        vector, then pursuing the cell that distance and direction away from
        Blinky. Inky's starting position is between (11, 15) and (12, 15).</li>
        <li>Clyde (Orange) - The orange ghost starts inside the ghost house
        and waits until at least one third of the dots have been eaten before
        leaving.  In scatter mode, pursues the tile one below the
        bottom left corner wall (this is not reachable, so it will never
        reach its target).  In chase mode, Clyde calculates his linear distance
        from Pacman.  If it is at least 8, it pursues the cell Pacman occupies.
        If it is less than 8 cells away, it pursues the same cell as it would
        in scatter mode (until it is at least 8 tiles away again). Clyde's
        starting position is between (15, 15) and (16, 15).</li>
    </ul>
    The last caveat about ghost movement is that they will in scatter and
    chase modes, ghosts will NEVER choose to move upward at the following four
    intersections, using (0, 0) as the top left wall: (12, 25), (15, 25),
    (12, 12) and (15, 12).  This restriction does not apply in frightened
    mode.  This implementation is OPTIONAL.</li>
</ul>
